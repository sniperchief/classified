/**
 * # A Zcash wallet
 *
 * This is the main entry point for interacting with this library.
 * For the most part you will only need to create and interact with a Wallet instance.
 *
 * A wallet is a set of accounts that can be synchronized together with the blockchain.
 * Once synchronized, the wallet can be used to propose, build and send transactions.
 *
 * Create a new WebWallet with
 * ```javascript
 * const wallet = new WebWallet("main", "https://zcash-mainnet.chainsafe.dev", 10);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Adding Accounts
 *
 * Accounts can be added by either importing a seed phrase or a Unified Full Viewing Key (UFVK).
 * If you do import via a UFVK it is important that you also have access to the Unified Spending Key (USK) for that account otherwise the wallet will not be able to create transactions.
 *
 * When importing an account you can also specify the block height at which the account was created. This can significantly reduce the time it takes to sync the account as the wallet will only scan for transactions after this height.
 * Failing to provide a birthday height will result in extremely slow sync times as the wallet will need to scan the entire blockchain.
 *
 * e.g.
 * ```javascript
 * const account_id = await wallet.create_account("...", 1, 2657762)
 *
 * // OR
 *
 * const account_id = await wallet.import_ufvk("...", 2657762)
 * ``
 *
 * ## Synchronizing
 *
 * The wallet can be synchronized with the blockchain by calling the `sync` method. This will fetch compact blocks from the connected lightwalletd instance and scan them for transactions.
 * The sync method uses a built-in strategy to determine which blocks is needs to download and scan in order to gain full knowledge of the balances for all accounts that are managed.
 *
 * Syncing is a long running process and so is delegated to a WebWorker to prevent from blocking the main thread. It is safe to call other methods on the wallet during syncing although they may take
 * longer than usual while they wait for a write-lock to be released.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * await wallet.sync();
 * ```
 *
 * ## Transacting
 *
 * Sending a transaction is a three step process: proposing, authorizing, and sending.
 *
 * A transaction proposal is created by calling `propose_transfer` with the intended recipient and amount. This will create a proposal object that describes which notes will be spent in order to fulfil this request.
 * The proposal should be presented to the user for review before being authorized.
 *
 * To authorize the transaction the caller must currently provide the seed phrase and account index of the account that will be used to sign the transaction. This method also perform the SNARK proving which is an expensive operation and performed in parallel by a series of WebWorkers.
 *
 * Finally, A transaction can be sent to the network by calling `send_authorized_transactions` with the list of transaction IDs that were generated by the authorization step.
 *
 * ## PCZT Transactions
 *
 * PCZT (Partially Constructed Zcash Transaction)
 *
 * 1. **`pczt_create`** - Creates a PCZT which designates how funds from this account can be spent to realize the requested transfer (does NOT sign, generate proofs, or send)
 * 2. **`pczt_sign`** - Signs the PCZT using USK (should be done in secure environment)
 * 3. **`pczt_prove`** - Creates and inserts proofs for the PCZT
 *
 * The full flow looks like
 * The full PCZT flow: `pczt_create` → `pczt_sign` → `pczt_prove` → `pczt_send`
 * ```
